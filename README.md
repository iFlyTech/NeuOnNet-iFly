# NEUON Supercharged\nNeuOn - Improved Neural Network Primarily Focused on Lip Sync detection in video streaming under the ownership of iFlyTech.\n\n##Concept\n\nCheck out these research papers for a deeper dive into the concept:\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.05739.pdf\n\nhttps://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2016/Chung16a/chung16a.pdf\n\n##Dataset\n\nWe have self-prepared the project dataset according to The VoxCeleb1 Dataset description found at http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/vox1.html\n\nMake sure to adapt to the current folder layout as it varies from the layout when the download and clipping scripts were made.\n\n## Used Components\n\n - youtube-dl: To download video from Youtube by URL\n - FFMpeg(licenced under LGPL2.1): To decode media source, perform video framerate conversion and audio samplerate conversion\n - Aquila(licensed under MIT): For audio feature extraction. Original code was patched to provide MFEC feature alongside original MFCC\n - Dlib(Licensed under Boost 1.0 License and CC-0 for pretrained model): For face landmark detection with pre-trained model\n - Keras(Licensed under MIT) + other Python libraries(documentation is in progress)\n\n##Implementation\n\nHere are steps maintain and run this project:\n - Download video from Youtube(res/download.sh)\n - Clip the media file based on markers f
