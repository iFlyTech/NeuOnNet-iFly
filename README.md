# NEUON Supercharged\nNeuOn - Improved Neural Network Primarily Focused on Lip Sync detection in video streaming under the ownership of iFlyTech.\n\n##Concept\n\nCheck out these research papers for a deeper dive into the concept:\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.05739.pdf\n\nhttps://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2016/Chung16a/chung16a.pdf\n\n##Dataset\n\nWe have self-prepared the project dataset according to The VoxCeleb1 Dataset description found at http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/vox1.html\n\nMake sure to adapt to the current folder layout as it varies from the layout when the download and clipping scripts were made.\n\n## Used Components\n\n - youtube-dl: To download video from Youtube by URL\n - FFMpeg(licenced under LGPL2.1): To decode media source, perform video framerate conversion and audio samplerate conversion\n - Aquila(licensed under MIT): For audio feature extraction. Original code was patched to provide MFEC feature alongside original MFCC\n - Dlib(Licensed under Boost 1.0 License and CC-0 for pretrained model): For face landmark detection with pre-trained model\n - Keras(Licensed under MIT) + other Python libraries(documentation is in progress)\n\n##Implementation\n\nHere are steps maintain and run this project:\n - Download video from Youtube(res/download.sh)\n - Clip the media file based on markers from VoxCelebs1 dataset description(res/clip.sh)\n - Extract audio and video features using neuon-data tool(res/dataset.sh)\n - Combine all features data samples to dataset list (cat + awk + paste.... WIP)\n - Train the network with the dataset(src/neuon-training.py)\n - Verify the network with other samples(src/neuon-test.py)\n\n##Known Limitations\n\nThe project has limitations including:\n - File only\n - Resample audio to strange samplerate to fulfill Aquila implementation limitation: sample amount before FFT must be equal power, but sample amount depends on video framerate to have aligned data sample size to use in the neural network.\n - Python dependencies and hardware requirements for training may make the program hard to deliver\n\n## Windows Env\n\nPrerequisites: python3, cmake, git, 7zip, wget, VS2019 Community for C++\n```shell\nb2 -j8 link=static threading=multi variant=release toolset=msvc-16.0 --build-type=complete runtime-link=shared --prefix=d:\work\env\boost\1.72\stage --build-dir=d:\work\env\boost\1.72\build --layout=tagged architecture=x86 address-model=64 install
